;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package gives an overview of the current regex search
;; candidates.  The search regex can be split into groups with a
;; space.  Each group is highlighted with a different face.
;;
;; The overview back end can be either `helm' or `ivy'.
;;
;; It can double as a quick `regex-builder', although only single
;; lines will be matched.
